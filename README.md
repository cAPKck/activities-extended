# activities-extended (FoundryVTT module)

:warning: Requires the [Dungeons & Dragons 5e game system](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/dnd5e).

This FoundryVTT module provides extended automation functionality and configuration options for activities and effects of the D&D 5e module for FoundryVTT.

The provided functions are generally rooted in what I use for my campaign, but I try to keep them as generally usable as possible.

If you have any questions and/or requests, feel free to comment.
